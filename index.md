#### Q: What is a Data Plan?
A data plan is a service provided by mobile carriers, offering users internet access on their mobile devices for a set fee. 

<a id="basic-how-to-set-data-plan"></a>
#### Q: How to Set the Data Plan?
You would need to set the period and the data amount your plan has. All of this can be edited from the Data Plan card.

<a id="basic-how-to-disable-data-plan"></a>
#### Q: How to Disable Data Plan?
You can disable the data plan using the switch if you just want to monitor data on a daily basis. 

<a id="basic-diff-manual-auto-period"></a>
#### Q: Difference Between Manual & Auto Period?
- Auto: Automatically sets the next billing cycle or period
- Manual: You set the period yourself

>**Note**: Plan Period dates will be highlighted in red if the today's date is not in range with the period selected.

<a id="basic-diff-daily-plan"></a>
#### Q: Difference between Daily & Plan Usage?
- Daily usage refers to the amount of data consumed within a single day.
- Plan usage encompasses the total data usage within the entire billing cycle specified by your mobile carrier.

<a id="basic-data-amount"></a>
#### Q: What is a Data Amount?
It is the maximum amount of internet data you can use within your billing cycle without incurring extra charges or experiencing reduced speeds.

<a id="basic-data-untracked-amount"></a>
#### Q: What is Untracked Amount?
It is the amount of data usage from your mobile internet plan that occurred before you installed the Data Pill app. This added amount will be included in your total usage for the current period or cycle. It helps ensure that the total usage on the app matches the total usage on your mobile plan, resolving any discrepancies. Note that the app can only monitor data usage from the time it is installed, so the Untracked Amount feature helps account for any prior usage.

<a id="basic-daily-limit"></a>
#### Q: What is Daily Limit?
The daily threshold set by the app to tell you that you've exceeded the daily limit through a notification if enabled or a visual progress. It's good to budget your data daily as it keeps track of your daily data consumption and ensures that you stay within your data plan's limits.

<a id="basic-plan-limit"></a>
#### Q: What is Plan Limit?
Just like the Daily Limit, it is a threshold but for the overall plan for your current period or within your billing cycle.

<a id="what-is-a-pill"></a>
#### Q: What is a Pill?
A Pill is like a pill-shaped meter showing how much data you've used daily or for the whole plan. It gives you a quick snapshot of your usage progress, helping you stay on top of your data limits effortlessly.

<a id="how-to-show-weekly"></a>
#### Q: How to Show Daily Usage for the Week?
When you tap the pill, it reveals multiple pills stacked on top of each other. Each individual pill represents the data usage for a specific day within the week. This visual display allows you to easily track your data consumption patterns over time, seeing how much data you've used on each day of the week at a glance. It's a convenient way to gain insight into your usage habits and make informed decisions about your data usage management.

Tips: 
- To reveal the pills behind, you can drag the current pill out of the view.
- To display a simple comparison of the different usages, you can long-press the background and it will show you multiple lines where each line shows you how much data you have used for each day.

<a id="widget-not-updating"></a>
#### Q: Why Widget is not Updating?
Widgets typically update every 5 minutes to provide the latest usage information. However, there are occasions when the widget may not update or take some time to update. This could occur if you're not actively using the app or if you've reached the maximum daily limit of 40-60 refreshes.

<a id="widget-blank"></a>
#### Q: Why My Widget is Blank / Black?
On iOS 17, the widget may turn black after updating the app. This is bug on iOS we couldn't resolve. To fix this for the meantime, restart your device or add or remove the widget from the homescreen.
